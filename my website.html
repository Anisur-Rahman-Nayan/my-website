        <p class="colour">I don’t know if I am passionate about being a web developer. I find it really easy to get involved in the projects I work on though. You get into the system of thought, find a way to build it/change it/fix it, and the release it to whoever needed it. It’s a fun cycle. It has plenty of headaches along the way, but overall, it’s a cool thing to do. I learn interesting tricks/tools/techniques along the way  </p>

        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p class="colour">I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like country’s peace, I like metropolis’ noise; I like the beautiful Ramna lake in Dhaka. I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies. I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.</p>
